    <string name="about_description">Author: Morgan E Jones.\n\nThis application is set up for you to
        manually organise the people you follow into categories and for tweets within these categories
        to then be sorted into the threads based on what each one is talking about.\n\n
        *MAIN MENU*\n— Hold to delete a category, click to view its feed and swipe left to edit
        the category.\n\n*CATEGORIES*\n— When editing a category, click the name to edit it.\n— To
        add a new category: click to expand below, enter a name and then click the green Add new
        Category to save it.\n\n*THREADS*\n— Blue words are keywords which match the thread.
        Red are negative words, and green are positive.\n— Links in tweets are redacted and
        instead can be viewed by clicking the link button which will be blue if enabled. The other
        two buttons are for standard favouriting and retweeting.\n\n*ASSIGN USERS*\n— Clicking
        on assign users below will take you to the setup screen. All contacts who have not yet been
        assigned will appear. Check next to the name to assign the user to the title category. Click
        on the next arrow then to move onto the next category and to finish when done. You will then
        be redirected to the main screen so that tweets can be processed.</string>
